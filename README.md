# Evolutionary Computing Optimization

Homework tasks from course Evolutionary Computing Optimization led by Professor Marko Čupić, Domagoj Jakobović & Marko Đurasević, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing

In this course, we needed to implement different evolutional algorithms from scratch in Java. The most interesting one for me was homework 6, where we need to reconstruct an image with a certain number of rectangles using genetic algorithm. You can find the generated image in HW6/images.
