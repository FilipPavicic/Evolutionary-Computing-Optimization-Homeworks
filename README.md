# Evolutionary Computing Optimization

Homework's from course Evolutionary Computing Optimization led by Professor Marko Čupić, Domagoj Jakobović & Marko Đurasević, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing

In this course, we needed to implement an evolutional algorithm from scratch in Java. The most interesting  HW was homework 6 where we need to reconstruct an image with a certain number of rectangles which needed to be found by genetic algorithm. You can find generated image in HW6/images.
